ENGI E1006 Final Project 
I have incorporated JavaScript, CSS and HTML through Flask for Python, to create a Website.

My Website has 3 pages:
1. My Homepage
2. My Modular Exponentiation Calculator
3. My Fermat Primality Checker

I have cited all images as and when they occur on the website.
In addition, I have consulted the following 2 sources extensively:
1. https://www.w3schools.com: to better understand HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
2. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org: to better understand implementation of Modular Exponentiation and the Fermat Primality Test.
